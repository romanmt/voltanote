# Project Structure

This is an Elixir/Phoenix application with the following key directories:

## Phoenix Application Structure

- **/lib**: Main application code
  - **/lib/voltanote**: Core application modules
  - **/lib/voltanote_web**: Web interface and controllers

- **/config**: Application configuration files
  - Contains environment-specific configurations

- **/assets**: Frontend assets
  - JavaScript, CSS, and other frontend resources

- **/priv**: Private application data
  - Database migrations
  - Static files

## Neo4j Integration

The application uses Neo4j AuraDB for storage. Key considerations:
- Graph data model for interconnected notes
- Optimized queries to stay within free tier limits
- Connection management for the remote AuraDB instance
