# Technology Stack

## Backend
- **Elixir/Phoenix**: Primary application framework
- **Neo4j AuraDB**: Graph database (free tier) for storing interconnected notes
  - Leverages relationships between notes for Zettelkasten methodology
  - Efficient querying of connected information

## Deployment
- **fly.io**: Cloud deployment platform (free tier)
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment

## Development Considerations
- Maintain zero cost by staying within free tier limits
- Optimize database queries to stay within Neo4j AuraDB free tier limitations
- Follow Elixir/Phoenix best practices for maintainable code
